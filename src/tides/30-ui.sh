  TIDES -- harmonic tide prediction, with no network and no subscription

  tides                    the menu
  tides near <lat> <lon>   the stations nearest a position
  tides find <text>        search for a station by name
  tides use <id>           choose a station
  tides today [date]       the day's table, curve and depth helper
  tides sky [date]         the same, with the moon and sun panel
  tides where              which station is chosen, and where the files are
  tides day|night|plain    colour mode
  tides about              what this is, where the data comes from
  tides version

  Dates are YYYY-MM-DD.  Times are the station's own standard time -
  no summer time, exactly like a printed tide table.

  FINDING A STATION

  Nobody guesses a station's exact name: the database calls a place
  "NEW LONDON  State Pier" or "Chappaquoit Point  West Falmouth
  Harbor".  So type part of it and pick from the numbered list.

  Every word you type has to appear somewhere in the name, the state
  or the country, but in any order and anywhere inside a word, so
  "lon new" finds New London just as well as "new london" does.

  If you want more control, the text is used as a regular expression
  the moment it contains any of  ^ $ . [ ] | ( ) * + ? { } \

    tides find "^st mary"        names that start with St Mary
    tides find "bay$"            names that end in Bay
    tides find "falmouth|mystic" either one
    tides find "port.*bay"       Port, then anything, then Bay

  A pattern that is not a valid regular expression is searched as
  plain text instead rather than refusing to answer.

  A tide cannot be computed from a position. It depends on the shape of
  the coast and the depth and resonance of the basin, so every place
  needs constants somebody measured there. That is why you pick a
  station and not a place, and why the nearest one by straight line can
  be on the wrong side of a headland.

  TIDES -- what it is, and what it is not
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Harmonic prediction from constants measured at each station, with
  no network and no subscription. 8,334 stations: 6,090 with their
  own harmonic constants and 2,244 that offset from a neighbour,
  which is exactly how a printed tide table is built.

  CHECKED AGAINST NOAA's OWN PUBLISHED TABLES.  Twenty-four high and
  low waters at six stations spanning small and large ranges, mixed
  and diurnal regimes: a mean error of 2.4 minutes and 1.0 cm, worst
  5.9 minutes and 2.0 cm. The fixture is committed, so the check runs
  with no network like everything else here.

  WHAT IT DOES NOT KNOW.  The weather. A deep low can raise the sea
  half a metre above prediction and a hard high can drop it as far;
  wind piles water onto a lee shore and drains a weather one. River
  flow after rain does the same. A prediction is the astronomical
  tide and nothing else, and on the day the water does what it
  likes.

  Nor does it know about summer time. Times are the station's own
  standard time, exactly like a printed table, because that is what
  the offsets in the data are referenced to.

  DATA.  NOAA harmonic constants: works of the U.S. federal
  government, public domain. TICON-4 harmonic constants: Piccioni,
  Dettmering, Schwatke, Passaro and Seitz, CC BY 4.0. Assembled by
  way of the neaps tide-database project, CC BY 4.0. That attribution
