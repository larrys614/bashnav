    '' \
    '  The deck log, the engine log and the provisions list, kept in one' \

    '  A LOG IS A RECORD' \
    '' \
    '  It has standing after an incident, and it is read by people who were' \
    '  not there. So:' \
    '' \
    '    - it is APPEND ONLY. Nothing is ever edited or deleted.' \
    '    - a CORRECTION is a new entry that references the old one, and both' \
    '      stay visible for ever. That is the electronic version of lining' \
    '      through and initialling, which is how it has always been done.' \
    '    - every timestamp is UTC. Display is another matter; the record is' \
    '      UTC, so nobody has to argue later about whose local time it was.' \

    '  invented numbers, and an invented number in a log is worse than a' \
    '  gap, because it looks like data.' \

    '  Zero is a reading. "Cloud nil" and "cloud not observed" are different' \

    '' \
    '  There is no stored inventory. What an impeller IS - its number, what' \
    '  it fits, how many to carry - is registry. How many you HAVE is worked' \
    '  out by replaying the log. So the count can never disagree with the' \
    '  log, because it is the log.' \

    '  observes and how it is coded, so the coded fields here are theirs,' \
    '  not ours. Learn this form and you have learned the professional one,' \
    '  and your log is comparable with every other marine observation ever' \
    '  taken.' \
