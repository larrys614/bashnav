#  corrections are new entries that reference the old one, and every

#  Appending.
#
#  awk BUILDS and VALIDATES the record; the shell appends it with a
#  single >> of one line.  Two reasons.  One append of a short line is
#  as close to atomic as this platform gets, which matters when iOS can
#  suspend the app mid-write.  And there is then exactly one place that
#  knows the format, which is the awk record layer.
#
#  Fields are handed over in a temp file as  key<TAB>value  so a value
#  may contain anything a person can type, including | and =.
