  HOW IT WAS WRITTEN
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  By Claude, Anthropic's AI model, in conversation with Larry over
  a few days in August 2026.  He decided what it should do and
  judged whether it was right.  The code, the mathematics and the
  tests are Claude's work.

  Three rules were set at the start and never relaxed.

  PORTABILITY.  POSIX sh and POSIX awk, and nothing else.  It runs
  in a-Shell and iSH on an iPad, in Terminal on a Mac, in busybox
  on a router.  Nothing is installed.  There is no dependency here
  that can rot in a year, because there is no dependency.

  NO NETWORK, EVER.  Every number the program needs is inside the
  file you are running.  That is a constraint on the mathematics
  and not only on the plumbing: it is why the planetary positions
  are computed from orbital elements with a correction series
  fitted here, rather than looked up in a table someone serves.

  NOTHING ASSERTED THAT WAS NOT CHECKED.  Each algorithm is
  implemented from a primary source and then validated against an
  independent implementation - never against itself.

  On that last one, honestly.  An AI writing code is confidently
  wrong on a regular basis, and so is a person.  The defence is
  not care, it is testing.  Real errors in this project were found
  by machinery and by users, and would not have been found by
  reading the code:

    - One awk implementation ignores the seed you give its random
      number generator.  A drill could therefore mark its own
      correct answer wrong.  Found by running the suite under four
      different awks, not by inspection.

    - Both tools worked out "am I writing to a terminal?" from
      inside a command substitution, where the answer is always
      no.  Colour had never once worked, on any terminal, since
      the day it was written.  The test suite checked that the
      output is clean when piped - and passed, for entirely the
      wrong reason.

    - The three green lights of a mine clearance vessel were drawn
      on two different masts.  A user saw that before any test
      did, because he tried to account for every light in the
      picture and could not.

  So: the tests exist because the author is fallible, and the
  interesting mistakes were caught by the tests and by the people
  using it.  Which is the argument for sending feedback.

  FEEDBACK
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Please send it.  It is the reason this is public.

  The useful report is small and specific:

    what you did        the exact command, or which menu item
    what you saw        paste it, escape codes and all
    what you expected   and why - the rule, the sight, the table

  "This is not right, a sailing vessel would not show that" with
  the picture pasted underneath is worth more than any amount of
  general praise, and has already fixed real bugs.

  Where:

    https://github.com/larrys614/bashnav/issues

  If you think the program disagrees with the Convention, with an
  almanac, or with a published tide table, say so plainly.  Assume
  the program is wrong until it is shown otherwise.  That is the
  correct prior, and it is how the bugs above were found.

  Corrections to the teaching are as welcome as corrections to the
  code.  If a lesson is misleading, that is a defect.
