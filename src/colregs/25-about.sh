    '  FTG2/SS - a fire control technician, submarines - in USS Alaska' \
    '  (SSBN-732), USS Lafayette (SSBN-616), USS Gato (SSN-615) and USS' \
    '  Greenling (SSN-614).  Two ballistic missile boats and two fast' \
    '  attacks, which is two quite different trades: one hides and one' \
    '  goes looking.  He stood the manoeuvring watch on the fire control' \
    '  tracking party, managing contacts and avoiding collisions through' \
    '  places like the Strait of Gibraltar and the Race - the tide gate' \
    '  at the mouth of Long Island Sound, and the door you go out of' \
    '  from Groton.' \
    '' \
    '  Thirty-six years on he is sailing round the world in the' \
    '  Clipper Race, and he wanted a few things that would work on an' \
    '  iPad in the middle of an ocean: no signal, no subscription, no' \
    '  account to log in to, no data to download first.' \
    '' \
    '  So: the rules of the road, drawn.  You learn lights by looking' \
    '  at lights, from the angle you would actually see them, and by' \
    '  being asked what you see and getting it wrong.  Reciting Rule 25' \
    '  does not teach you to recognise a sailing vessel at two miles on' \
    '  a black night.  Being shown one, guessing, and being told why' \
    '  you were wrong does.' \

    '  The contacts section is the method he was taught in the Navy,' \

    '    signal appliances.  Published by the International Maritime' \

    '    same table draws her from any angle, and a mistake in the' \
    '    table shows up as a picture that cannot be accounted for.' \
    '    Annex I is what the numbers are built from.' \
