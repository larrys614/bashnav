# =====================================================================
#  deck-log -- forecast, verify, score.
#
#  THE ORDER IS THE POINT.  The user's forecast is committed to the log
#  BEFORE the app shows any of its own reasoning.  Print the guess first
#  and the person has not forecast anything - they have read an answer
#  and agreed with it.  It feels like learning and is not.  Same bug as
#  the colregs lights quiz telling you the aspect and then asking for
#  it; house rule now: never tell before you ask.
#
#  AND THREE ARE SCORED, not one.  Scoring only the user would make this
#  an oracle and it is not one: every rule in it is a rule of thumb.
#  Scoring the rules too keeps it honest, teaches calibration, and lets
#  the user eventually win - which is the point, because a training tool
#  that cannot be outgrown is badly built.
#
#  The third is PERSISTENCE: "in twelve hours it will be much as it is
#  now."  It is the honest floor.  Hard to beat at short range, and a
#  forecast that does not beat it has shown no skill at all.  Standard
#  practice in operational meteorology, and free.
# =====================================================================

#  Error points, taken from the WxChallenge: weighted, continuous, low
#  score wins.  A near miss should score like a near miss, which one
#  right/wrong verdict per forecast cannot express.
