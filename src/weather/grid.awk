#  weather -- the character grid, for the one figure this tool draws.
#
#  WHY THIS IS A FOURTH COPY, and what the alternative is.
#
#  celnav, colregs and tides each carry their own grid. The SETTERS are
#  the same in all three; `gshow` is not, and that is the point: celnav's
#  carries the FIGDUMP path the web generator needs, colregs' paints its
#  own panel so the artwork is legible whatever the terminal profile is,
#  and tides' calls col_init() itself. Extracting the lot would mean
#  rewriting `gshow` in three working tools to serve a figure in a fourth,
#  which is a large blast radius for a small gain.
#
#  So this is celnav's grid, FIGDUMP path included, copied rather than
#  shared. The honest version of that trade: if a fifth tool ever needs
#  one, extract the setters into src/common/ and leave each tool its own
#  `gshow` - the setters are nine lines and genuinely identical, and the
#  divergence is all in the painting.
#
#  Drawing conventions, so this reads the same as the other three:
#    row 0 is the TOP, column 0 is the left
#    gput overwrites, gputw writes only into blank space
#    the c-suffixed forms take a colour; the others inherit the panel's
# =====================================================================
#  THE PANEL COLOURS ARE DEFINED HERE, not in src/common/colour.awk.
#  That file is shared with another tool and gives C_BASE and C_RST; it
#  has no panel concept. celnav's own col_init() adds C_PANEL and C_EOL,
#  and gshow() below needs them -- copied without this, every name would
#  be the empty string and the figure would print with no panel at all.
#  On a light terminal profile that is white artwork on white, which is
#  the exact failure docs/HACKING.md records for the colregs lights.

#  THE TWO SHELLS, DRAWN.  Coriolis's demonstration, as a picture.
#
#  WHY THIS FRAME AND NOT THE OTHER ONE.  The lesson tells the story in
#  the inertial frame, where nothing curves and nothing pushes, and that
#  is the honest account.  It does not DRAW: at true proportions a
#  shell's path in that frame is a straight radial line and the ground
#  turns under it by an invisible amount -- which is exactly why the real
#  deflection is a couple of hundred metres and not ninety miles.  Drawn
#  at a scale
#  where the rotation shows, the "straight line" wraps most of the way
#  round the pole and stops looking like gunnery at all.
#
#  So this is the GUNNER'S frame, which is what a range table's diagram
#  shows: the line of fire, the track, and where the shell actually
#  lands.  Two panels side by side, because the point of the figure is
#  the punchline -- fired north it lands east, fired south it lands west,
#  and both of those are to the RIGHT of the line of fire.  One panel
#  cannot show that; two show it without a word.
#
#  WHAT IS COMPUTED AND WHAT IS SCALED.  The cross-track deflection goes
#  as the SQUARE of the time of flight -- the rotating frame's
#  acceleration 2*Omega x v is constant along the track, so the offset is
#  a parabola -- and the curve drawn here is that parabola, computed, not
#  a hand-drawn arc.  Its SIZE is scaled to the width of the panel and
#  the caption says so, with the real figure beside it.  A figure that
#  silently exaggerated would be teaching the wrong magnitude, which in
#  gunnery is the whole game.

# =====================================================================
#  THE SURFACE WIND ROUND A LOW, and the arithmetic under it.
#
#  Larry asked for this demonstration and asked me to check the science
#  first, which was the right instinct: the version he described had the
#  wind crossing the isobars LESS as the pressure gradient rose, with
#  centrifugal force as the cause. That is not what happens, and the
#  reason is worth stating where the code is, because the wrong version
#  is the intuitive one.
#
#  1. IN A FRICTIONLESS BALANCE THE WIND ALREADY FOLLOWS THE ISOBARS
#     EXACTLY, at every gradient and every latitude -- geostrophic,
#     gradient and cyclostrophic balance alike. So "follows them more
#     closely" cannot be a centrifugal effect. There is nothing for it
#     to improve on.
#
#  2. FRICTION is what turns the wind across the isobars. Slowed air
#     feels less Coriolis, so pressure wins a little and the flow spirals
#     in. With a linear drag k the steady balance solves exactly:
#
#            tan(alpha) = k / f        |V| / Vg = cos(alpha)
#
#     and the pressure gradient CANCELS OUT of the angle. A deeper low
#     gives more wind at the same angle, not a smaller angle.
#
#  3. WITH REALISTIC QUADRATIC DRAG IT GOES THE OTHER WAY. Friction over
#     water goes as V squared, so the angle GROWS with the gradient. The
#     strongest lows on earth have the largest inflow angles -- a
#     hurricane's boundary layer runs 20-30 degrees of inflow -- which is
#     the clearest refutation available.
#
#  4. LATITUDE IS THE REAL DIAL, through f = 2*Omega*sin(lat). Same drag,
#     50 degrees of inflow at 10 N and 12 at 75 N.
#
#  5. CENTRIFUGAL IS REAL AND CHANGES THE SPEED, NOT THE ANGLE. Round a
#     low it points outward, adding to Coriolis against the pressure
#     gradient, so the gradient wind is SUBgeostrophic; round a high it
#     subtracts and the wind is supergeostrophic. The high has a hard
#     limit where no solution exists at all, which is why tight intense
#     highs do not occur and tight intense lows do.
#
#  This lives here beside the figure that draws it rather than in wx.awk,
#  because nothing in the tool's own reasoning uses it. If `weather what`
#  ever reasons from a gradient, it moves to wx.awk.

#  The wind crossing an isobar, in characters.  Thirty-four columns, like
#  the gun, so it fits the device the tool is for.
#
#  WHY THIS IS NOT THE CIRCLE THE BROWSER DRAWS, and it was built as the
#  circle first. Eight arrows round an isobar need eight unambiguous
#  arrowheads, and a character cell has four: > < ^ v. The diagonals have
#  to be "/" and "\\", which carry an AXIS and not a direction - so on the
#  flanks of the circle, where the wind blows up-and-inward, the arrow
#  reads equally well as down-and-outward, and the figure says the
#  opposite of what it means to half its readers. Drawn and looked at
#  before it was thrown away.
#
#  So the terminal gets the one claim the figure exists to make, drawn so
#  it cannot be misread: ONE isobar, the gradient wind along it, and the
#  surface wind crossing it toward the low at the computed angle. The
#  browser, which has real arrowheads at any angle, draws the circle with
#  its eight.
#
#  The cell aspect is deliberately IGNORED here. Cells are about twice as
#  tall as wide, so halving the vertical component the way wind_glyph()
#  does would draw a true 15 degrees as about 8 on screen - correct
#  geometry, and useless as a picture of an angle. The angle is drawn as
#  it reads and printed as it is.
