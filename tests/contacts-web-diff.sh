# Diff the browser contacts against the shell contacts, function by
# function -- the same check colregs-web-diff.sh runs, for the module
# that was until now shell-only.
#
# WHY A DIFF AND NOT A READING. The first version of the port was read
# twice and looked right. The diff failed on the second group of lines:
# ct_yd inserts thousands separators AND rounds to the nearest hundred
# yards, because a tracking party reports a range that way and the
# function is handed computed ranges -- ct_rng, the CPA, the Ekelund
# estimate -- not round numbers. The port had the commas and not the
# rounding, so every range in the browser would have read as a yard
# rather than a hundred.
#
# What it covers, over each function's whole useful range:
#
#   nrm360, sgn180   -360 to 720
#   rbrg             every integer component pair in a 11 x 11 box
#   xsrand / xrand   40 seeds x 6 draws -- a Park-Miller sequence that
#                    disagrees by one step diverges completely, so this
#                    is what makes the SEEDED exercises diffable at all
#   ct_yd            powers of seven, so the rounding is exercised
#   ek_across        5 speeds x 12 courses x 8 bearings
#   ek_gen           60 seeds, every field of the generated leg pair
#   ct_gen           60 seeds, every field of the generated contact
#   ct_brg, ct_rng   5 observations on each of 20 generated contacts
#

#  EVERY AWK ON THE MACHINE, NOT THE FIRST ONE FOUND.
#
#  This picked one awk, mawk-first, and compared it with node. On 23
#  October 2026 it passed on every machine I had and failed on Larry's
#  Mac, because macOS's /usr/bin/awk is one-true-awk and it alone
#  normalised a negative zero away -- so a bearing rate that rounds to
#  zero from below printed with the wrong sign, under a legend that
#  says what the sign means. One awk agreeing with node says nothing
#  about the others, which is the same reason CLAUDE.md says a gawk-only
#  run proves nothing.
