#  produce is captured as text and committed. A change to the code that

#  be looked at and accepted on purpose rather than slipping through.
#
#    tests/golden.sh            compare against the committed files
#    tests/golden.sh --update   rewrite them (read the diff first)
#
#  It cannot tell you whether the output is CORRECT - only whether it is
#  the same as it was. Correctness of the rules themselves is a job for

# ---- celnav: the deviation card ---------------------------------------
#  A swing is several checks, so the cases that differ in KIND are about
#  the swing and not about the arithmetic of one bearing, which
#  celnav-compass already pins.
#
#  The first swing is built backwards from a deviation of 3 sin(head+30),
#  so the card has a known answer: the eight rows must come back 1.5E,
#  2.9E, 2.6E, 0.8E and the mirror of that.  A change anywhere in the
#  azimuth chain moves those numbers and the diff says so in degrees of
#  deviation rather than in minutes of arc.
#
#  The other three are the refusals and the warnings, which are the part
#  of this command that is judgement rather than trigonometry: a swing
#  with no variation cannot make a card at all; three headings in one
#  quadrant is not a card; and a bearing taken with the body high is hard
#  to take over a compass whatever the arithmetic says.

# ---- celnav: every lesson, its figure and its answer ------------------
#  The lesson list comes from the app itself (cmd=t_codes reads the one
#  syllabus string), so a lesson added without a capture cannot slip
#  through unnoticed.  The figures are computed, not drawn by hand - the
#  cocked-hat panels in C1 are three real LOP crossings and print the
#  size of the hat in miles - so a change to the plotting helpers or to
#  the spherical trig shows up here as a readable diff and not only in
#  the almanac numbers.
