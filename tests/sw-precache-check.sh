#  Does each web tool's service worker cache everything its page loads?
#
#  THE OFFLINE PROMISE IS THE PRODUCT. These tools exist to work on a
#  boat with no signal, and the worker is cache-first precisely so that
#  nothing is fetched at sea. A file the page loads and the worker does
#  not precache is fetched from the network on first use: fine at the
#  dock, and on passage it is a stylesheet that never arrives or a
#  script whose absence takes a section of the app with it.
#
#  Nothing checked this. It is being written on 23 October 2026 because
#  the contacts module adds three scripts to colregs' page at once and I
#  was about to rely on remembering to add them in two places; the same
#  gap is open on all six tools and on the launcher.
#
#  Two things are compared, per tool:
#    1. every local script and stylesheet the page references is in the
#       worker's FILES list;
#    2. every file the FILES list names exists on disk, so a rename
#       cannot leave the worker precaching a 404 -- addAll() rejects as
#       a unit, so ONE missing entry means the tool caches NOTHING and
#       is online-only everywhere.
