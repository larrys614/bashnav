#  Every built tool must appear in a table of tools in the README AND have
#  a section of its own.  deck-log shipped with a section and no row, and
#  nothing noticed - the kind of gap that is invisible to the person who
#  wrote it and obvious to the first person who reads it.
#
#  And every link in the README must point at something that is there.
#
#  WHY THIS WAS REWRITTEN.  It used to assume one shape: rows of the form
#  "| **[name](#name)** |" and headings at exactly "## name".  The
#  browser-first README has two tables - the browser apps at the top,
#  linking to the published web builds, and the six shell scripts further
#  down, linking to their own sections - and the sections sit at "###"
#  under "## The six tools" and "## The shell build".  The old check read
#  a row's anchor with sub(/^[^(]*\(#/) and, on a row whose link is a URL
#  with no "#" in it, that substitution did nothing: it then reported
#  "the row for celnav links to #celnav](https://..." which is not an
#  anchor, not a heading, and not a useful thing to be told.
#
#  So the shape assumptions are gone.  What is checked is the PROPERTY:
#
#    1  every tool in bin/ is named by a table row, and has a heading
#    2  every "#anchor" link lands on a heading that exists
#    3  every link to .../bashnav/web/<name>/ lands on a browser build
#       that is actually in docs/web/ - a stronger check than the anchor
#       one it replaces, because a published app can go missing
#    4  every relative link lands on a file in the repository
#
#  Anchors are slugged the way GitHub slugs them: lowercased, anything
#  that is not a letter, digit, space or hyphen dropped, spaces to
#  hyphens.  Every heading in this README is one or two plain words, so
#  that is enough; a heading with punctuation in it would need more.
