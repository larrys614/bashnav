#  When a served file changes, its app's service-worker cache version must
#  change with it.
#
#  Every app's worker is cache-first with no revalidation:
#
#      caches.match(req).then(hit => hit || fetch(req)...)
#
#  so a file already in the cache is served from it FOR EVER. The cache is
#  only refilled when install runs, and install only runs when the worker
#  changes - in practice when CACHE is bumped. An install on somebody's
#  home screen therefore keeps the old app indefinitely, with no error and
#  nothing to see.
#
#  That is not hypothetical. celnav's sight-reduction screen, the fix that
#  was 43 nm out from a stale DR and the planets' missing parallax all
#  shipped while CACHE stayed at celnav-v3, so every existing install kept
#  serving the old code. Larry found it the only way it can be found - by
#  opening the app and seeing the old one. tests/sw-precache-check.sh
#  already checks that every served file is IN the list; nothing checked
#  that the list gets refetched.
#
#  The comparison is: the commit that introduced the current CACHE value,
#  against HEAD, over the files that worker precaches. Anything changed in
#  between is a file an existing install will never receive.
