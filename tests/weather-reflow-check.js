/*  Does weather's reflow keep every word, every emphasis, and every
    figure?

    The lessons were written for a terminal and arrived as one paragraph
    per 70-column line. drawLines() now gathers consecutive lines into a
    paragraph and joins the prose -- which puts three things at risk, and
    none of them would show up as an error:

      1. A WORD IS LOST OR MOVED at a seam. Each line's screen indent is
         trimmed and a single space goes in; an off-by-one in that and a
         paragraph reads almost right.

      2. AN EMPHASIS COMES OFF. The accent is per-SPAN, not per-line, so
         joining lines means concatenating span runs. "water vapour does
         not add molecules to the box, it REPLACES them" turns on the one
         word that is emphasised; merge the spans carelessly and the word
         is still there with the emphasis gone.

      3. A FIGURE IS FLOWED. The H2O/O2 diagram indents "O2  32" to sit
         under "N2  28". Flowed into a sentence it is not wrong, it is
         meaningless -- and it was already meaningless in a proportional
         font before any of this.

    The third test uses its own idea of what a figure is -- three or more
    spaces inside a line -- rather than asking wxKind() whether it agrees
    with itself, because a check that asks the code to confirm its own
    rule passes for ever.

    Both the lesson body and its deeper section are checked: drawLines()
    renders both, which is the whole reason it is one function.  */

    were never in the shell lesson. Comparing them against the shell's
    words fails by construction.
