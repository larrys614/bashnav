#  THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR
#
#  Every tool kept its engine, config and log in $HOME/.<tool>.  On iOS
#  that is refused: a-Shell's own README says "In iOS, you cannot write
#  in the ~ directory, only in ~/Documents/, ~/Library/ and ~/tmp",
#  because $HOME there is the app's data container.
#
#  So not one of the six would start on an iPad - the platform this
#  whole project exists for.  Larry got
#
#      celnav: cannot create /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/...
#
#  and reported "a could not create container error", which is exactly
#  what that says if you are reading the path and not the verb.
#
#  Nothing caught it because every machine the suite runs on has a
#  writable $HOME.  This check takes that away.

#  Print where we are BEFORE each step, not after.  This check hung on a
#  Mac and the only information anybody had was "it stopped on a blank
#  line".  With the suite's guard killing it after 180s, whatever step
#  printed last is the step that hung -- which is the whole diagnosis,
#  without needing sh -x or a second run.
