#  A REVIEWER'S JUDGEMENT MUST SURVIVE HIM WALKING AWAY FROM THE PROMPT.
#
#  Larry marked three claims in the mot section -- two wrong, one with a
#  comment -- and none of the three reached review.tsv. The file's last
#  write was hours earlier, at the end of the encounter section. His own
#  guess was right: "I ctrl-c out of the last session, that might me it."
#
#  The sequence: he presses f, rv_ask_note's `read` blocks, he presses
#  ctrl-c to get his shell back so he can copy the screen into a chat,
#  and SIGINT kills the script before rv_save on the same line runs.
#
#  Three things are asserted here, each of which was broken:
#
#    1  the verdict is on disk before the note is asked for, so SIGINT
#       at the note prompt costs the note and not the judgement;
#    2  a note written afterwards supersedes the bare verdict row, so
#       the report carries the reviewer's words;
#    3  [return] advances. rv_next returns the first claim with no row,
#       and skipping writes no row, so "carry on from where I left off"
#       re-offered the same claim for ever.
