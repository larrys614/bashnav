# Diff the web colregs against the shell colregs, function by function.
#
# The web README says the geometry is "ported function-for-function, with
# the same names, so the awk and the JS can be read side by side", and
# that they are "also diffed: both implementations are run over all 361
# integer bearings and the output compared."
#
# THAT CHECK WAS NOT IN THE REPOSITORY. Nothing ran it, and the first time
# it was run -- 22 October 2026 -- it found aspect_words had its own arc
# boundaries in the JS (8, 75, 105, 172) where the awk delegates to
# rel_phrase with ahead=2.5. The two told the reader different things
# about the same geometry, on 580 of the 361 aspects, for as long as the
# web build has existed.
#
# So this is the check the README describes, written down. It compares
# every function the two share, over its whole input range, as strings:
#
#   rel_phrase   360 bearings x 2 possessives
#   aspect_words 361 aspects
#   arc_vis      6 arc types x 361 bearings
#
# Run from the repository root:  sh tests/colregs-web-diff.sh

#  EVERY AWK ON THE MACHINE, NOT THE FIRST ONE FOUND.
#
#  This picked one awk, mawk-first, and compared it with node. On 23
#  October 2026 it passed on every machine I had and failed on Larry's
#  Mac, because macOS's /usr/bin/awk is one-true-awk and it alone
#  normalised a negative zero away -- so a bearing rate that rounds to
#  zero from below printed with the wrong sign, under a legend that
#  says what the sign means. One awk agreeing with node says nothing
#  about the others, which is the same reason CLAUDE.md says a gawk-only
#  run proves nothing.
