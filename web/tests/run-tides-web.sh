#   sh web/tests/run-tides-web.sh --full     615 stations x 4 dates
#
# What each stage proves:
#
#   1  the engine     every number the JS computes, against the number the
#                     awk computes, over thousands of station-days
#   2  the page       what the page SHOWS, against the awk tool's own
#                     output.  A module diff cannot catch a wiring fault,
#                     and the one that mattered -- predicting the UT day
#                     and labelling it in station time -- passed every
#                     module diff while the table was visibly wrong
#   3  the moon       the drawn phase against the computed fraction
