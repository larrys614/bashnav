# Verify the browser deck-log build against the awk tool.
#
# The log is append-only and SHARED with the awk build: the same file,
# byte for byte, not two formats that look alike. A record one tool
# writes that the other cannot read is permanent damage, discovered
# months later by something trying to read it. So the record layer is
# checked in BOTH directions before anything else.
#
#   sh web/tests/run-decklog-web.sh
#
#   1  the record layer   awk writes, JS reads; JS writes, awk reads;
#                         byte for byte, including a note containing | and
#                         = and a newline, and truncation at every offset
#   2  the derived views  holdings and open defects over generated logs
#   3  plausibility       the limits AND the wording, over the whole range
#   4  the merge          commutative, idempotent, lossless, conflicts kept
#   5  the page           a real entry made through the UI, exported, and
#                         read back by the awk tool
