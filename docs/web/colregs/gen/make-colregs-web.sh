# Regenerate docs/web/colregs/data.js from src/colregs/engine.awk.
#
# THE README PROMISED THIS AND IT WAS NOT HERE. data.js says "regenerate
# with work/dump.awk and work/mkdata.py" and there is no work/ in the
# repository -- deck-log, weather and tides all carry their gen/ and
# colregs' was lost. So the one thing the file claims, that the web build
# and the shell build cannot drift, was not true: on 22 October 2026 the
# shell gained a wind field and a vessel-kind field on the encounters and
# the browser could not see either of them, and there was no path to bring
# them across but typing.
#
# The tables are CODE, not data: ves_init() and the rest build their rows
# at run time from ar() calls and shared constants, so this runs the
# initialisers and prints what they actually built. The lessons are
# printed by les(), so they are captured from a real run.
#
# Run from anywhere:  sh docs/web/colregs/gen/make-colregs-web.sh
