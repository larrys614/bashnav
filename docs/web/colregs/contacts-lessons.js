A very large vessel. You take the bearing of her bridge.\n     She is 300 metres long. Her bow is a cable and a half from the mark\n     you plotted, and it is the bow that reaches you.\n  2. A tow.

Closing rate is the range change per\n  minute - read it straight off two marks, no trigonometry.\n  8,000 yards closing 600 a minute is thirteen minutes.

A slow\ncontact close in and a fast one far out produce exactly the same drift,\nand no amount of watching will separate them.\n\nSo you change the geometry yourself. Run a leg, note the bearing rate;\nalter course or speed, settle, run another leg, note it again. Her\nmotion across your line of sight has not changed - she is doing what she\nwas doing. Every bit of the change in bearing rate is YOURS, and it is\nyours by a known amount. That gives you the range:\n\n  range in kiloyards  =  1.91 x (change in your speed across the\n                          line of sight, knots)\n                          / (change in bearing rate, deg per min)\n\n  Your speed across the line of sight is your speed times the sine of\n  the angle between your course and her bearing. Beam on, all of it;\n  dead ahead, none of it.\n\n  The 1.91 is just units: 2,000 yards to the mile over 60 minutes,\n  times 57.3 degrees to the radian.\n\nWorked. She bears 040. You are on 000 at 12 knots and her bearing is\nopening 0.9 degrees a minute. You come round to 090, still 12 knots,\nand it settles at 2.4 a minute.\n\n  across, leg 1 = 12 x sin(000 - 040) = -7.7 knots\n  across, leg 2 = 12 x sin(090 - 040) =  9.2 knots\n  range = 1.91 x (9.2 - -7.7) / (0.9 - 2.4) = 1.91 x 16.9 / -1.5\n        = -21.5 ... take the size: 21,500 yards.\n\nThree things will ruin it, and they are worth knowing better than the\nformula:\n  1. She manoeuvres during the legs. The whole method assumes she did\n     not, and it cannot tell you that she did - it just gives you a\n     confident wrong answer.\n  2. The legs are too short, or you take the rate before the ship has\n     settled on the new course.\n  3. You barely changed your speed across the line of sight. Then the\n     top of the fraction is small, the bottom is smaller, and the noise\n     runs the answer. Turn far enough to matter.\n\nWhich is the real lesson of it: a solution you have not manoeuvred\nagainst is a guess wearing a number."

Royal Navy and British\n  practice, and the reason it sticks is that the colours are the\n  sidelights: your own red light looks out over your port bow, so\n  Red is port. It is unambiguous over a bad intercom because the\n  side is a word, not a number that can be misheard.\n\n  Port and starboard. \"Port 20\", \"Starboard 30\". The same thing\n  in plainer words. United States practice also uses the full\n  circle - \"bearing 340 relative\" - measured clockwise from your\n  own bow, which is neater on a plot and worse in the dark.\n\nAnd the words, which need no number at all:\n\n    right ahead                       000\n    fine on the bow         out to about 35\n    broad on the bow                   045\n    on the beam                        090\n    broad on the quarter               135\n    fine on the quarter     in from about 145\n    right astern                       180\n\nBroad on the bow is four points, and four points is 45 degrees.\nBroad on the quarter is four points the other way from astern.\nEverything in the middle is fine, and everything near the beam is\nthe beam. The edges are convention, not law - nobody will correct\nyou for calling 40 degrees fine rather than broad, and nobody will\nmisunderstand you either. That is the point of them.\n\n  Now the trap, and it is a real one.\n\nA relative bearing changes when SHE moves. It also changes when YOU\nmove, by exactly as much, and it cannot tell you which happened.\n\nAlter twenty degrees to starboard and every contact on the board\ndraws twenty degrees left, all at once, with nothing at all having\nchanged out in the water. A contact that holds Green 30 through your\nturn has in fact swung twenty degrees - which is the opposite of the\ncomfort a steady relative bearing seems to offer.\n\nSo: bearing drift is measured in TRUE bearings, or on a steady\n  course, and never across a turn. Everything in C2 and C3\nassumes it. If you take marks either side of an alteration and read\nthe drift off them, you will get a confident answer that is wholly\ninvented. Take the marks, alter, settle, and start a fresh plot.\n\nThis is also, from the other end, exactly why Ekelund works: the\nchange you put in yourself is known, so it can be subtracted out.\n\nOn a yacht it is the same problem in cheaper equipment. A hand\nbearing compass gives you a magnetic bearing you can plot. A pair\nof eyes and a shroud gives you a relative bearing, instantly, in\nthe dark, with no instrument at all - and the shroud stays where it\nis only while you hold your course. Steer straight for the two\nminutes you are watching her, or the drift is worthless.\n\nWhich of these this program uses is a setting, because the right\nanswer depends entirely on who is listening.  colregs style, or s\nfrom the contacts menu, and it describes each one before you pick.\n\nSay both, when it matters: the true bearing so it can be plotted,\nthe relative so it can be seen.\n\n  \"Master 2, bearing 311, Red 20, drawing left, range 14,200.\""
