//  GitHub Pages serves every file with  cache-control: max-age=600  -
//  measured, not assumed: ten minutes, and a Fastly edge in front of it
//  with an age of its own. So for ten minutes after a push, addAll() is
//  entitled to fill a brand new cache with the PREVIOUS version's files.
//  The worker would then report its new CACHE name while serving old
//  content, which is worse than being plainly out of date: the version
//  says one thing and the bytes say another, and the one check a reader
//  has - the build line at the foot of the page - would lie to them.
//
//  'reload' bypasses the browser's cache for each fetch and goes to the
//  network. Still all-or-nothing: every response is fetched and checked
//  before anything is written, because a cache half-filled from two
//  versions is the state nothing can diagnose. That was addAll()'s one
//  virtue and it is kept deliberately.
