# weather — the browser build

Read your own barometer. A port of `src/weather/`, reasoning from the
observations `deck-log` keeps, with no network at all.

    index.html        the reasoning, the forecast loop, the score, the chart, the lessons
    wx.js             the rules, and the atmospheric tide correction
    score.js          the two machine forecasters, and the scoring
    chart.js          the 500 millibar rules
    lessons.js        the ten lessons (generated)
    log.js, store.js  deck-log's record layer (copied, byte-identical)
    weather.js        the app
    gen/              the generator
    ../tests/         the verification

## The honest limit, which is in `about` as well

**With no network this cannot forecast.** No GRIBs, no synoptic charts,
no models. What it does is make you your own forecaster from the
barometer, the sky and the wind. Celestial is what you do when GPS dies;
this is what you do when the sat comms die.

It works entirely in the **observation** column of the three kinds of
weather data — ground truth you measured. It cannot forecast, but what
it reasons *from* is the one category that is never wrong, and the one
still available when the antenna comes down.

## One shared store, and why that works here

This reads the log `deck-log` writes, in the same IndexedDB. Both tools
are served from one origin, and **IndexedDB is per-origin, not
per-path**, so `docs/web/weather/` and `docs/web/deck-log/` genuinely share one
store. That is the design the specification asks for: the watch stander
says the report once.

A service worker's *scope* is per-path, though, which is why `log.js`
and `store.js` are **copied** here rather than loaded from
`../deck-log/`. Out of scope, the worker would not cache them and the
tool would not work offline — which is the entire point.
`gen/make-weather-web.sh` keeps the copies byte-identical and fails if
they ever drift, because two readers of one append-only format is the
one thing this project cannot afford.

## Every rule shows its working

A forecast handed over without its reasoning teaches nothing; the
explanation is the product. So each rule emits what it concluded and,
separately, why, and the page shows both — the conclusion as a
statement, the working under it as an aside.

The **atmospheric tide** is corrected before anything is said about
tendency, and said out loud. Solar heating drives a pressure wave that
travels westward with the sun, dominantly *semi*diurnal — twice a day,
not once. In the tropics the glass falls two to three millibars between
mid-morning and mid-afternoon *every day in perfect weather*, and a
sailor who does not know that reads a routine afternoon fall as a system
approaching. It needs your longitude, which is why the home screen asks
for it.

## Never tell before you ask

The forecast screen shows **nothing** of the app's reasoning until your
own call is committed to the log. Not greyed out, not collapsed, not
behind a tap — absent, and not in the DOM either. A guess you can
glimpse is a guess you have read, and then you have not forecast
anything: it feels like learning and is not. The test asserts the
comparison table is empty before the commit, not merely hidden.

The same rule runs the lessons: each ends with a question, and the
answer is not in the page until it is asked for.

## Three are scored, not one

    you          your own call
    the rules    the app's reasoning
    persistence  "in twelve hours it will be much as it is now"

**Persistence is the honest floor.** Hard to beat at short range, and a
forecast that does not beat it has shown no skill at all. Scoring the
rules as well as you keeps the app honest — its misses go on the record
— teaches calibration, and lets you eventually win, which is the point.
A training tool that cannot be outgrown is badly built.

Weighted error points from the WxChallenge: half a point per knot, one
per millibar, a tenth per degree of wind direction, so a near miss
scores like a near miss. Wind direction is scored **on the circle** —
350° forecast against 010° observed is a 20° error, not 340°.

### The user's own column was missing

`do_forecast` wrote `by=user`; the score sheet's three names are `you`,
`rules` and `persist`. So the one column the whole learning loop exists
for was accumulated and then never looked at, and "You are beating the
rule set" could never fire. Found while porting this, fixed in the awk
too, and **normalised on read** rather than by renaming the writer
alone: the log is append-only, so every `fc` record already written says
`user` and has to keep working for ever.

The test that was supposed to cover this wrote its own fixture with
`by=you` and so never met the tool. It now drives `weather forecast`,
logs the observation the forecast was made for, and reads the tool's own
score sheet.

## Regenerating and verifying

    sh docs/web/weather/gen/make-weather-web.sh
    sh docs/web/tests/run-weather-web.sh

`lessons.js` is **captured from the awk's own output**, in colour mode,
so the words *and the author's emphasis* are carried rather than
transcribed: `lph` marks a heading, `lpd` an aside, and `cw()` inside a
line marks the words that matter. The test reconstructs the plain text
from `lessons.js` and compares it with `weather learn` — all ten are
character-identical.

The verification compares **prose, character for character**: 400
generated observation histories against `weather what`, 300 logs against
`weather score`, 1,078 cases against `weather chart`, every real day
from 2000 to 2040 through the valid-time conversion both ways, and the
page driven end to end.

Two formatting faults it caught:

- **C's `printf` rounds half to even; JavaScript's `toFixed` does not.**
  `%.0f` of 12.5 is 12 in C and 13 in JavaScript. The 500 mb rules
  divide the wind by two, which lands on an exact half for every even
  wind speed, and 506 of 1,078 chart cases disagreed on precisely that.
  `WX.cfixed` expands the double's exact decimal and rounds the string.
- **C prints `inf`, not `Infinity`.** A 500 mb wind of zero divides by
  zero and the awk prints "inf to inf hours". The port says so too; the
  page refuses zero and explains why instead.

**Rules of thumb: good ones, and still rules of thumb.** What is tested
is that the app applies its stated rules correctly and reports its own
score honestly — not that the forecast is right. It will often be wrong;
that is the nature of the subject, and it is why both scorers exist.

The 500 mb rules are from Sienkiewicz and Chesneau, *Mariner's Guide to
the 500-Millibar Chart*, NOAA — public domain. Sources are in
`docs/SOURCES.md`; nothing in the lessons is copied from anywhere.
