// weather's own cache, scoped to this folder so it and the other tools
// update independently.
//
// The log itself is never cached: it lives in IndexedDB, shared with
// deck-log, and a cache is something the browser may throw away.
//  Bump on any change to a cached file. The worker is cache-first, so an
//  installed copy serves what it already has until THIS file's bytes
//  differ. The page no longer names this string -- it finds the cache by
//  prefix -- so bumping it here is all that is needed.
const CACHE = 'weather-v13'
//  this tool's family, derived from CACHE so there is no second
//  constant to drift out of step with it
const FAMILY = 'weather-';
//  ../shared/ IS PRECACHED TOO. The wind demonstration and the panel
//  stylesheet live one folder up, because the project's front page shows
//  the same live panel and one copy serves both. A file the page loads
//  and the worker does not precache is fetched from the network on first
//  use - fine at the dock, and at sea it is a section of the app that
//  never arrives. tests/sw-precache-check.sh compares these two lists.

//  EVERY FILE IS FETCHED PAST THE HTTP CACHE, and that is the whole point
//  of this block rather than a plain addAll(FILES).
//
//  GitHub Pages serves every file with  cache-control: max-age=600  -
//  measured, not assumed: ten minutes, and a Fastly edge in front of it
//  with an age of its own. So for ten minutes after a push, addAll() is
//  entitled to fill a brand new cache with the PREVIOUS version's files.
//  The worker would then report its new CACHE name while serving old
//  content, which is worse than being plainly out of date: the version
//  says one thing and the bytes say another, and the one check a reader
//  has - the build line at the foot of the page - would lie to them.
//
//  'reload' bypasses the browser's cache for each fetch and goes to the
//  network. Still all-or-nothing: every response is fetched and checked
//  before anything is written, because a cache half-filled from two
//  versions is the state nothing can diagnose. That was addAll()'s one
//  virtue and it is kept deliberately.
