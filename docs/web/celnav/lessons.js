     "s": "Everything else in this program needs a position to start from. A\nsight is reduced from an assumed position; a running fix is advanced\nalong a course and a speed; even deciding which of two circle\ncrossings is you needs a rough idea of where you are.\n\nDead reckoning is that idea, and it is the only position you can\nalways have. No sky, no satellites, no landmarks: just what you\nsteered, how fast, and for how long.\n\nIt is arithmetic and makes no claim to be true. That is not a\nweakness as long as you remember it.\n\nTHE METHOD\n\n  1. Distance run = speed x time. Nothing subtle.\n  2. Resolve it onto north and east:\n\n       northing = distance x cos(course)\n       departure = distance x sin(course)\n\n  3. Northing IS difference of latitude: one minute of latitude is\n     one nautical mile, everywhere on earth. That is what a mile is.\n\n  4. Departure is NOT difference of longitude. The meridians close\n     together toward the poles, so a mile of easting is worth more\n     than a minute of longitude:\n\n       difference of longitude = departure / cos(latitude)\n\nAt 50 degrees north, cos 50 is 0.64 - so a mile east is 1.56\nminutes of longitude. At 70 north it is nearly three. Forget this\nand your DR walks east or west of the truth, and the error grows\nwith latitude, which is exactly where the weather is worst.\nA worked run, computed by this lesson as you read it:\n\n    course 050 T    speed 6.5 kn    time 90 min\n\n                   N\n                   |\n                   |      /\n          northing |    /   distance 9.75 nm\n           6.27    |  /\n                   |/ 50 deg\n                   +------------ E\n                   departure 7.47 nm\n\n    difference of latitude      6.27'  = 6.27 nm\n    departure                   7.47 nm\n    cos(latitude 50)             0.641\n    difference of longitude    11.66'\n\nNote the last three lines. The departure and the difference of\nlongitude are different numbers for the same movement east."

The DR with what you know about the\n       water put back in - set, drift, leeway. Better than the DR,\n       and still an assumption rather than an observation.\n\n  FIX  Two or more lines of position, each from something outside\n       the ship.

A\nnavigator who cannot say which of the three a mark is has lost the\nonly thing that matters about it.\n\nWHY THIS MODULE COMES BEFORE THE SIGHTS\n\nA celestial fix is not independent of your DR. Three places it\nleans on it:\n\n  1. The assumed position comes from the DR. Put it far from the\n     truth and the intercept gets long, and a long intercept is\n     where the straight-line approximation starts to cost you.\n  2. A running fix advances the earlier line of position along your\n     course and speed. A log reading 5 per cent high puts that error\n     straight into the fix - and it will look like a good fix.\n  3. With one body you have a line, not a position. Which point on\n     that line you are is a DR question.\n\nSo the fix is only ever as good as the reckoning you ran it from.\nThat is the honest version of \"celestial navigation\": it is\nreckoning, corrected by observation, not observation alone.\n\nONE SHIP, THREE MARKS, FOUR HOURS APART"

But one lies close: Polaris,\na little over half a degree off. Here is why that matters.\n\n  1. The altitude of the celestial pole above your horizon IS your\n     latitude. Exactly, always, by the geometry of the thing - stand\n     on the equator and the pole is on your horizon; stand at the\n     pole and it is overhead.\n  2. So if Polaris sat ON the pole, you would measure your latitude\n     directly off the sextant, with nothing to correct and no\n     almanac to open.\n  3. It does not. It circles the pole once a day at that half a\n     degree and a bit, so it stands sometimes above the pole and\n     sometimes below it and mostly to one side.\n\nThe whole correction is therefore one question: where on that little\ncircle is Polaris right now? And its LHA answers it.\n\n     at upper transit, above the pole:   latitude = Ho - p\n     at lower transit, below the pole:   latitude = Ho + p\n     anywhere between:                   latitude = Ho - p cos LHA\n\nwhere p is the polar distance, 90 minus the declination.\n\n  4. The almanac prints this as Ho - 1 degree + a0 + a1 + a2. Do not\n     let the three columns suggest three ideas: they are one\n     correction, written as a series. a0 carries almost all of it\n     and depends on the LHA of Aries; a1 is a small term in your\n     latitude and a2 a smaller one in the month. The constant degree\n     is subtracted only so that all three columns can be printed as\n     positive numbers.\n  5. CELNAV does not need the series. It has Polaris's own GHA and\n     declination, so it solves the triangle the star is standing in\n     and gets the answer in closed form. Ask it for a sight and it\n     prints both: the first-order correction above, and the exact\n     one, so you can see the size of what a1 and a2 are for.\n\nTwo honest limits, and the first is not small.\n\n  6. There is no Polaris in the southern hemisphere. Nothing bright\n     sits near the south pole - Sigma Octantis is a degree off and\n     barely visible - so this method simply does not exist below the\n     equator, and a noon sight does the work instead.\n  7. It is one line, a parallel of latitude, and tells you nothing\n     about your longitude. What it does give you is time: Polaris\n     is up all night, so you are not waiting for a particular\n     moment the way you are at noon.\n\nAnd a long slow caveat worth knowing: Polaris has not always been\nthe pole star and will not stay one. The earth's axis precesses, so\nthe pole is drifting through the sky - Polaris is closing on it now,\nwill be at its nearest around 2100, and in two thousand years will\nbe nowhere near it. That is why the star catalogue in this program\ncarries proper motion and precession rather than fixed positions.\n\n  celnav polaris                   the correction right now\n  celnav polaris \"UT\" <Hs>         the latitude from your reading\n\n            Polaris goes round the pole once a day:\n\n                      upper transit\n                           *   latitude = Ho - p\n                        .     .\n                      .         .\n              *       .    + P   .       *\n          latitude    .         .     latitude\n          = Ho        .         .     = Ho\n                        .     .\n                           *   latitude = Ho + p\n                      lower transit\n\n  P = the celestial pole, whose altitude is your latitude.\n  p = Polaris's distance from it, about 37' at present.\n\nOut at the sides, Polaris is level with the pole and its altitude IS\nyour latitude. Above and below, it is wrong by the whole of p.

PARALLAX. The corrections you apply are all about turning what\n     YOU saw into what an observer at the centre of the earth would\n     have seen, because that is where the almanac stands. For the\n     sun, 93 million miles away, the earth's radius is nothing. The\n     moon is a quarter of a million miles away, so the earth's\n     radius is a real fraction of that, and the correction reaches\n     about 61 minutes - a whole degree, sixty miles of position.\n     It is not a refinement. It is the biggest number in the sum.\n  2. SEMI-DIAMETER, and it GROWS as the moon rises. You measure to\n     a limb, so you add or subtract the moon's half-width - but when\n     the moon is overhead you are one earth radius nearer to it than\n     when it is on your horizon, so it looks very slightly bigger.\n     That is augmentation, and it is about 0.3' at the zenith.\n     CELNAV applies it; most tables fold it into the main\n     correction.\n  3. WHICH LIMB. Half the month the lower limb is the lit one and\n     half the month it is not, so a moon sight is the one sight\n     where you routinely shoot the upper limb - and the\n     semi-diameter changes sign when you do. Get that wrong and you\n     are out by twice the semi-diameter, about half a degree, thirty\n     miles.\n\nThen the thing that catches people out, which is not a correction at\nall:\n\n  4. The moon moves about its own diameter in an hour. Half a degree\n     an hour is half a minute of arc a minute of time, so four\n     seconds of clock error is a tenth of a mile and a minute of it\n     is half a mile. Every sight wants the time to the second; this\n     one punishes you for less.\n\nAnd the reason to bother with all of it:\n\n  5. The moon is the only body besides the sun that is regularly up\n     in DAYLIGHT. A sun line crossed with a moon line is the one\n     two-body fix available at midday, when there is no twilight to\n     wait for and a running fix would mean two hours of hoping your\n     course and speed were honest. 'celnav plan' lists the moon\n     with its phase, and will say so when it is up with the sun.\n\nA sun sight first - the same one module S5 works through:\n\n  Hs  sextant reading       34 12.0'\n  index error                -1.5'  =\n  dip (height of eye)        -3.5'  ==\n  Ha  apparent altitude     34 07.0'\n  refraction                 -1.4'  =\n  parallax                   +0.1'\n  semi-diameter             +15.9'  =========\n  Ho  observed altitude     34 21.6'\n\nAnd a moon sight at the same height of eye, with the moon's own\nfigures for tonight out of the almanac:\n\n  (semi-diameter 15.5', horizontal parallax 57.0')\n\n  Hs  sextant reading       34 12.0'\n  index error                -1.5'  =\n  dip (height of eye)        -3.5'  ==\n  Ha  apparent altitude     34 07.0'\n  refraction                 -1.4'  =\n  parallax                  +47.2'  ==========================\n  semi-diameter             +15.7'  =========\n  Ho  observed altitude     35 08.4'\n\nSame sextant reading, same horizon, same air.

     "s": "After the moon, the planets are a relief. There are four a navigator\nuses - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn - and in the sextant they behave\nalmost exactly like stars.\n\n  1. NO SEMI-DIAMETER. A planet shows a disc only in a telescope; in\n     a sextant it is a point, so you bring the point itself to the\n     horizon and there is no limb to choose and no half-width to add.\n     That alone removes the two corrections that cause most mistakes\n     on the sun and the moon.\n  2. ALMOST NO PARALLAX - but not quite none, and this program used\n     to call it none. Venus comes within 0.27 of the earth's own\n     distance from the sun, and at that range its parallax reaches\n     0.5 minutes of arc near the horizon: half a mile. Mars reaches\n     0.2'. Jupiter and Saturn, four and eight times further out,\n     give three hundredths of a minute and can be forgotten. The\n     almanac prints an extra correction for Venus and Mars for\n     exactly this reason; CELNAV computes it for all four.\n\nWhat a planet does have, and a star does not, is motion of its own.\nThat is where the almanac's two odd little columns come from:\n\n  3. The almanac tabulates GHA and declination for each whole hour,\n     and you interpolate for the minutes and seconds. For a star\n     that works perfectly, because a star's GHA advances at the same\n     rate every hour for ever - the rate the earth turns.\n  4. A planet is also moving around the sun while you watch, so its\n     GHA does NOT advance at quite that rate, and the rate itself\n     changes through the year. The 'v' correction is the difference,\n     and 'd' is the same idea for the declination.\n  5. So v and d are not physics. They are the repair work that\n     tabulating by the hour makes necessary. CELNAV has no need of\n     either: it computes the position for the second you ask about,\n     from the orbit, so there is nothing to interpolate and nothing\n     to correct for having interpolated.\n\nAnd the practical reason to care about any of this:\n\n  6. The planets are BRIGHT. Venus at magnitude -4 and Jupiter at\n     -2 are far brighter than any star, so they show while the\n     horizon is still crisp - before the stars come out in the\n     evening and after they have faded in the morning. That widens\n     the twilight window at both ends, which is the scarcest thing\n     in celestial navigation.\n  7. Venus can be found in broad daylight if you know where to\n     look, which is the one thing 'celnav plan' is for: it lists\n     every planet that is up with its altitude, azimuth and\n     magnitude, so you can point the sextant at empty-looking sky\n     and find it there.\n\nVega, at a sextant reading of 20 degrees:\n\n  Hs  sextant reading       20 00.0'\n  index error                -1.5'  =\n  dip (height of eye)        -3.5'  ==\n  Ha  apparent altitude     19 55.0'\n  refraction                 -2.7'  =\n  Ho  observed altitude     19 52.3'\n\nAnd Venus, same reading, same horizon:\n\n  (a point source, so no semi-diameter; horizontal parallax 0.54')\n\n  Hs  sextant reading       20 00.0'\n  index error                -1.5'  =\n  dip (height of eye)        -3.5'  ==\n  Ha  apparent altitude     19 55.0'\n  refraction                 -2.7'  =\n  parallax                   +0.5'\n  Ho  observed altitude     19 52.8'\n\nOne row of difference, and it is a small one - which is the point.\nA planet is a star you can shoot earlier in the evening.

Two lines crossing at fifteen degrees pin it in one direction\n     and leave it almost free in the other. One minute of sextant\n     error slides the crossing four miles along that weak axis.\n  3.

Read seven lines, shoot them, plot them.\n\nThat is possible because the stars do not move relative to Aries\nwithin the life of an edition, so their declinations can be built\ninto the table instead of being an argument to it.\n\nTHE SELECTION IS ITSELF AN ALGORITHM. The seven are chosen bright,\nspread in azimuth, and in the honest altitude band - which is\nexactly what C1 said makes a good set, and exactly what celnav plan\ndoes when it picks the best three by azimuth spread.\n\nSo the app and the book are solving the same problem. They will\nsometimes disagree, and the disagreement is informative rather than\na fault: Volume 1 was computed for a whole degree of latitude and a\nwhole degree of LHA Aries, for an edition that has an epoch, and it\ndoes not know what the weather is doing to your horizon tonight.\n\nVolume 1 also carries the one thing this program cannot: it works\nwith no power at all, in a wet cockpit, by torchlight."

Applying it the wrong way is the\ncommonest error in the method and it is worth twice the correction,\nbecause you move the wrong way by the amount you should have moved\nthe right way.\n\nTHE OTHER TWO MISTAKES, both of which the tutor will name for you:\n\n  * an LHA one degree out. Silent, plausible, and worth about the\n    difference between two rows - twenty minutes of arc at a\n    workaday altitude, so twenty miles.\n  * reading Zn where the page prints Z. The two agree in one\n    quadrant and differ by a reflection everywhere else, which is\n    the worst kind of error: right often enough to feel safe.\n\nWork a sight both ways - tables mode in this app does it with you,\nand shows you the exact answer alongside - until the three are\nhabits rather than things to remember.\nThe interpolation, worked as you read it:\n\n    from the page, LHA 329      Hc 23 14.8'   d -56.0\n    declination                 11 07.5'S\n    correction  -56.0 x 7.5/60    -7.0'\n    interpolated Hc             23 07.8'\n\n    and solved exactly          23 07.8'\n    the table costs you         0.0'\n\nWhich is to say: the table has cost you nothing you could plot,\nfrom arguments of whole degrees.
