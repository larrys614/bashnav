# THE BUILD NUMBER AND THE CACHE VERSION MUST AGREE.  The worker is
# cache-first, so an installed copy keeps serving the drill.js it cached
# and a browser only reinstalls the worker when sw.js changes -- ship one
# without the other and the fix reaches nobody who has used the tool.
#
# This check already existed inside the browser suite, which meant it did
# not run on a machine without playwright. It then missed exactly what it
# was for: a drill.js that failed to reach the repository was committed
# alongside a bumped sw.js, and the published pair said build 4 and
# drill-v5. Two lines of grep would have caught it on any machine, so now
# they do.
