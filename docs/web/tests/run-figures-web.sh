#  ---- what counts as "changed" ------------------------------------
#  An SVG is the app's own drawing serialised, and it is byte-stable: any
#  difference at all is a real difference.
#
#  A PNG is a screenshot, and a screenshot of an UNCHANGED page is not
#  byte-stable. Two consecutive captures of the celnav noon screen came
#  back 97 pixels different out of 1,083,600, maximum channel delta 6 -
#  font antialiasing, invisible under a crop, and gone on the next run.
#  Byte-comparing them made this check go red on pictures that were
#  correct, and a check that cries wolf is a check nobody reads.
#
#  So PNGs are compared by PIXELS, with the headless Chromium that just
#  took them doing the decoding - no image library to install. Under the
#  threshold the picture is put back, so the working tree stays clean;
#  over it, the run fails and says by how much.
NOISE_PX=400          # out of a million-odd: 0.04 per cent
NOISE_DELTA=24        # one channel, out of 255
