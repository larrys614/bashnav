# Architecture

Why the code is shaped the way it is. Read `HACKING.md` for the rules;
this file is the map.

## The constraint that decided everything

The target is an iPad running [a-Shell](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/),
at sea, out of signal, on a boat where the chartplotter is the thing that just
failed. From that one requirement, everything else follows:

- **No dependencies.** POSIX `sh` and POSIX `awk` are what a-Shell has. Not
  Python, not bash, not gawk.
- **No network, ever.** Not at install, not at runtime, not for data. There is
  a test that greps the whole tree for `curl`, `wget`, `nc -`, `telnet`, `ftp`
  and `getline < "http…"` and fails the build if any appears.
- **No install step.** Each tool is one executable file. Copy it, `chmod +x`,
  run it. Nothing to unpack, nothing to `pip`, no second file to lose.
- **Nothing to configure.** A config file appears on first use with sensible
  defaults, in the tool's own dotfolder.

Everything awkward about the codebase — the heredoc packing, the shell/awk
split, the hand-rolled random number generator — is downstream of that list.

---

## One tool, one file

`build.sh` concatenates `src/<tool>/*` into a single executable in `bin/`.
The awk engines are embedded as **quoted heredocs** inside a shell function,
so the file is a shell script that carries its own awk source as data:

    install_engine() {
      ...
      cat > "$ENGINE" <<'__COLREGS_ENGINE__'
      ...the whole of src/colregs/engine.awk...
    __COLREGS_ENGINE__
    }

The quoting on `<<'__COLREGS_ENGINE__'` matters: it stops the shell expanding
`$1`, backticks and `\` inside the awk source. Without the quotes the awk gets
silently mangled.

On first run the tool writes its engines into its own dotfolder and from then on
runs them from there. **Where that folder goes is decided at run time, not
fixed to `$HOME`** — see below. The extracted files are **versioned by filename**
(`engine-1.15.awk`), so a newer binary never runs an older engine; and
extraction repeats if the executable is newer than the extracted engine
(`[ "$0" -nt "$ENGINE" ]`), so editing and re-running just works.

    ~/.celnav/    engine-1.6.awk  teach-1.6.awk  celnav.conf
    ~/.colregs/   engine-1.15.awk  contacts-1.15.awk  review-1.15.awk  colregs.conf
    ~/.tides/     engine-1.1.awk  tables-1.1.awk  stations.dat  config  lastlist
    ~/.bashnav/   decklog-1.1.awk  weather-1.0.awk  log  boat  *.conf

### `$HOME` is not writable on iOS, so the folder is chosen, not assumed

`src/common/05-home.sh` defines `bn_home`, spliced into every tool by
`build.sh` between the shebang and the first use. It takes the first of
`$HOME`, `$HOME/Documents`, `$HOME/Library` that it can **create and write in**,
proved by writing a file rather than by guessing from the platform.

`$HOME` is tried first, so nothing changes on macOS, Linux, the BSDs or Termux.
On a-Shell it lands in `~/Documents/.celnav`, because `$HOME` there is the app's
iOS data container and every write to it is refused. A `<TOOL>_HOME` environment
variable still overrides the lot and skips the probe, which is what the test
suite uses.

This is not a nicety. Every tool defaulted to `$HOME/.<tool>` and **not one of
them would start on an iPad** — the platform the whole project exists for.
`tests/ios-home.sh` takes a writable `$HOME` away and is now part of the matrix.

`bin/tides` is 2.9 MB because it carries 8,334 stations of harmonic constants
inline. Extraction takes about 48 ms, once.

**`bin/bashnav` is the exception and carries nothing.** It is a launcher: pure
`sh`, no awk, no engine, no dotfolder, no config. It exists because an iPad
puts *one* icon on a home screen far more easily than five, and because a
Shortcut that runs an interactive tool has to be set to run **In App** rather
than in a-Shell's extension - the extension has no terminal, so a menu has
nothing to draw on. Both routes are documented in the README; the launcher is
the one that needs no Shortcut at all.

**`bin/` is generated. Never edit it.** CI rebuilds and fails if the result
differs from what is committed.

## The shell/awk split

The division is strict and worth preserving:

| | |
|---|---|
| **shell** (`10-head.sh`, `30-ui.sh`) | menus, prompts, reading keystrokes, config, colour mode, choosing an awk |
| **awk** (`engine.awk`, …) | every calculation and every drawing |

The shell never computes anything and awk never reads from the keyboard. That
is what makes the engines testable: every screen the user sees can be produced
by one `awk -f engine.awk -v cmd=… ` invocation with no terminal, which is
exactly what the golden-file suite does with 27,245 lines of expected output.

### The engine interface

The shell calls awk through a one-line wrapper defined in `10-head.sh`:

    eng()   { $AWK -f "$TABLES" -f "$ENGINE" -v cmode="$(cmode_now)" -v SF="$STATIONS" "$@" </dev/null; }

Everything is passed as `-v` variables; a `BEGIN` block dispatches on `cmd`:

    cmd=day  cmd=near  cmd=search  cmd=info  cmd=height            (tides)
    cmd=light  cmd=shape  cmd=enc  cmd=scen  cmd=track  cmd=rv…    (colregs, 37 of them)
    cmd=reduce  cmd=almanac  cmd=plan  cmd=stars  cmd=compass      (celnav)

Note the `</dev/null` on every call. awk with no file arguments reads stdin,
and an engine that is only supposed to compute will otherwise sit there
swallowing the terminal.

Commands that *mark* an answer are separate from commands that *pose* the
question — `enc` and `encm`, `qlight` and `qlightm`, `scen` and `scenm`. Both
are driven from the same seed, so a drill can be regenerated exactly for
marking without the shell having to remember anything. That is also what makes
"every drill marks its own correct answer as correct" a testable property.

## Drawing

Every picture is a character grid built in awk and coloured with ANSI escape
sequences. Three modes, remembered in the config:

- **day** — light text on a black panel
- **night** — deep red on black, *no green at all*, because rebuilding dark
  adaptation takes twenty minutes and a bright screen costs every one of them
- **plain** — no escape sequences whatsoever

Plain is chosen automatically whenever stdout is not a terminal, so redirected
output is always clean text. **The tty test must happen at the top level of
the script, not inside `cmode_now()`** — see `HACKING.md`; this ate the colour
on every real terminal for weeks.

Every drawing paints its own black background edge-to-edge rather than only
setting a foreground colour, because a user on Apple Terminal's default light
profile otherwise gets white text on white.

## The tide data pipeline

    neaps/tide-database  ──►  src/tides/gen/make_stations.py  ──►  stations.dat
    (NOAA + TICON-4)          src/tides/gen/make_tables.py    ──►  tables.awk

The generators run offline on a developer's machine and their **output is
committed**. They are not part of the build and the tools never run them.

`stations.dat` is one station per line, pipe-separated:

    R|id|name|region|country|lat|lon|tzmin|z0mm|datum|idx:amp_mm:phase_tenths,...
    S|id|name|region|country|lat|lon|tzmin|refid|htype|hhi|hlo|thi|tlo

`R` is a **reference** station with its own harmonic constants (6,090 of them).
`S` is a **subordinate** station with no constants of its own — only time and
height corrections applied to a reference station's high and low waters, which
is exactly how a printed tide table is built (2,244 of them).

Amplitudes are stored in millimetres and phases in tenths of a degree — finer
than the constants are actually known, and it keeps the file near a megabyte.

Times are always the **station's own standard time**, never summer time,
because that is what the offsets in the source data are referenced to. A tide
table has always been in standard time.

### Data licensing, which travels with the data

- NOAA harmonics: **public domain**
- TICON-4 harmonics: **CC BY 4.0**
- assembled via `neaps/tide-database`, itself CC BY 4.0

The CC BY obligation travels with the data regardless of the Apache 2.0 licence
on the code. `NOTICE` carries it and must not be dropped.

## What is deliberately not here

- **No position input.** A tide cannot be computed from a position — it depends
  on the shape of the coast and the depth and resonance of the basin, so every
  place needs constants somebody measured there. You pick a *station*, not a
  place. The nearest one by straight line can be on the wrong side of a
  headland and behave nothing like you.
- **No tidal streams.** The 8,334 stations are height stations. Set and drift
  is a different measurement made at different places; nothing here predicts a
  current. See `REPO-STATE.md` for where that is going.
- **No weather.** A prediction is the astronomical tide and nothing else. A
  deep low can raise the sea half a metre above it.
- **No GPS, no AIS, no charts.** These are cross-checking and training tools.
