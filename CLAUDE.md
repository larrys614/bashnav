# Read this before changing anything

Bash Navigation Software: five marine tools and a launcher, written in POSIX
`sh` and POSIX `awk`, with no dependencies, no network, and no install step.
They are meant to run on an iPad in a-Shell, at sea, on a boat with no signal.

    celnav    celestial navigation, sight reduction, the fix, a teaching track
    colregs   rules of the road, lights, encounters, contact management
    tides     harmonic prediction, 8,334 stations worldwide
    deck-log  the boat's records: deck, engine, provisions, spares
    weather   read your own barometer, and the physics under it
    bashnav   a launcher, pure sh - one home-screen icon reaching all five

Larry Sherman has the ideas and the sea time; Claude writes the code. If you
are a later session picking this up, these four documents are the handover:

| | |
|---|---|
| [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | how the thing is built and why it is shaped this way |
| [`docs/HACKING.md`](docs/HACKING.md) | the rules you must not break, and the bug that taught each one |
| [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) | what the suite checks, and why each check exists |
| [`REPO-STATE.md`](REPO-STATE.md) | where things stand and what is next |

Read `docs/HACKING.md` before you write a line of awk. Most of it is not
obvious, none of it is stylistic, and every rule in it is there because
something shipped broken.

## The two-line version

    ./build.sh              # src/ -> bin/ ; run this after ANY edit to src/
    ./tests/run-tests.sh    # every shell x every awk on the machine

Never edit `bin/` directly. It is generated, CI checks that it matches `src/`,
and your change will be silently overwritten by the next build.

## The five rules that break things silently

1. **POSIX awk only.** No gawk extensions. Test under `mawk` *and* `gawk` —
   gawk accepts things mawk refuses outright, so a gawk-only run proves
   nothing.
2. **Never name a variable after an awk built-in.** `RS`, `RT`, `NR`, `FS`,
   `NF`, `OFS`, `ORS`, `RSTART`, `RLENGTH`, `SUBSEP`, `FILENAME`, `CONVFMT`,
   `FIELDWIDTHS`, `IGNORECASE`. `tests/awkvars-check.awk` enforces this.
3. **Never let a function parameter shadow a function name.** Illegal in
   POSIX; gawk tolerates it, mawk refuses to parse the file.
   `tests/fnparam-check.awk` enforces this.
4. **No newline after the `:` of a ternary.** gawk sometimes allows it, mawk
   never does.
5. **POSIX `sh`, not bash.** No arrays, no `[[`, no `local`, no `$'...'`, no
   `${var,,}`. It has to run under dash and under a-Shell's shell.

## The standard that governs

For `colregs`, the COLREGs as published by the IMO. Where the program and the
Convention differ, **the Convention is right and the program is wrong**. The
tools are training and cross-checking aids and say so, in each `about`
section, in `SAFETY.md`, and on the site. Do not soften that language.

## Working with Larry

He is a former US Navy FTG2/SS — fire control technician, submarines,
1984–1990, on *Alaska*, *Lafayette*, *Gato* and *Greenling*. He stood the
manoeuvring watch and worked in the fire control tracking party, so he knows
relative motion, bearing drift and manual solutions cold, and the contacts
module in `colregs` is built from methods he remembered and I then verified.

He is not a programmer. He reports what he *sees* — "still no color", "it
jumps one char to the right" — and those reports are consistently accurate
descriptions of the symptom. They are not diagnoses, and twice now I have
wasted rounds by treating them as one. See the entry on the lights picture in
`docs/HACKING.md`.

When he says something you built is wrong about the sea, he is usually right,
and the disagreement is usually about mechanism rather than about the claim.
Check what the data can actually support before agreeing or arguing.
